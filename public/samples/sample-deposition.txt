Q: Good morning, Ms. Martinez. Please state your full name for the record.
A: Sarah Elena Martinez.

Q: What is your current position at Metro Construction?
A: I am the Senior Project Manager, responsible for overseeing residential construction projects.

Q: How long have you held this position?
A: Approximately three years, since January 2021.

Q: Were you involved in the Johnson residential project that began in March 2023?
A: Yes, I was the primary project manager for that development.

Q: Can you describe the scope of work for the Johnson project?
A: It was a custom home construction project valued at approximately $485,000. The work included foundation, framing, electrical, plumbing, and finishing work.

Q: Were there any delays in the project timeline?
A: Yes, we experienced several delays. The initial completion date was set for September 2023, but we didn't finish until February 2024.

Q: What caused these delays?
A: Multiple factors. First, we had weather-related delays during foundation work in April 2023. Second, there were permit issues with the city that took six weeks to resolve. Third, we discovered soil conditions that required additional engineering consultation.

Q: Did Metro Construction communicate these delays to the Johnson family?
A: We attempted to communicate delays as they arose. I personally called Mrs. Johnson on three occasions to discuss timeline adjustments.

Q: Do you have documentation of these communications?
A: I have call logs and some email correspondence. The project files should contain copies.

Q: Were there any cost overruns on the project?
A: Yes, the final project cost was $523,000, approximately $38,000 over the original contract price.

Q: What contributed to these overruns?
A: Primarily the soil remediation work, which required additional materials and engineering consultation. Also, the permit delays resulted in carrying costs for materials on site.

Q: Did the client approve these additional costs?
A: We provided written change orders for the soil work totaling $28,000, which were approved. The remaining $10,000 was absorbed by Metro Construction.
